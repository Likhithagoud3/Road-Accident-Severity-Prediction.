# Road-Accident-Severity-Prediction.

The **Road Accident Severity Prediction App** is a **Machine Learning application** designed to predict the severity of road accidents using real-world traffic data. The app categorizes accidents into **Slight, Serious, or Fatal** and provides **confidence scores** along with **actionable safety recommendations** to help drivers and authorities make informed decisions for safer roads. This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from data collection to model deployment, showcasing practical skills in **Python, ML, and Streamlit deployment**.


## 🌟 Project Highlights

- Built with **Python** & popular ML libraries  
- Interactive deployment using **Streamlit** 🌐  
- Real-time predictions with **actionable insights** ⏱️  
- Focus on **road safety and preventive measures** 🚦  
- End-to-end workflow: **data collection → preprocessing → model training → deployment** 🔄
